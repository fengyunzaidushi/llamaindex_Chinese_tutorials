# # Building Evaluation from Scratch
# 
# We show how you can build evaluation modules from scratch. This includes both evaluation of the final generated response (where the output is plain text), as well as the evaluation of retrievers (where the output is a ranked list of items).
# 
# We have in-house modules in our [Evaluation](https://gpt-index.readthedocs.io/en/latest/core_modules/supporting_modules/evaluation/root.html) section.

# ## Setup
# 
# We load some data and define a very simple RAG query engine that we'll evaluate (uses top-k retrieval).

#('mkdir data')
#('wget --user-agent "Mozilla" "https://arxiv.org/pdf/2307.09288.pdf" -O "data/llama2.pdf"')

query_engine = index.as_query_engine()

# ## Dataset Generation
# 
# We first go through an exercise of generating a synthetic evaluation dataset. We do this by synthetically generating a set of questions from existing context. We then run each question with existing context through a powerful LLM (e.g. GPT-4) to generate a "ground-truth" response.

# ### Define Functions
# 
# We define the functions that we will use for dataset generation:

# ## Evaluating Generation
# 

# 
# We go through the following evaluation algorithms:
# - **Correctness**: Compares the generated answer against the ground-truth answer.
# - **Faithfulness**: Evaluates whether a response is faithful to the contexts (label-free).

# ### Building a Correctness Evaluator
# 
# The correctness evaluator compares the generated answer to the reference ground-truth answer, given the query. We output a score between 1 and 5, where 1 is the worst and 5 is the best.
# 
# We do this through a system and user prompt with a chat interface.

Output a single score that represents a holistic evaluation.
You must return your response in a line with only the score.
Do not return answers in any other format.
On a separate line provide your reasoning for the score as well.

Follow these guidelines for scoring:
- Your score has to be between 1 and 5, where 1 is the worst and 5 is the best.
- If the generated answer is not relevant to the user query, \
you should give a score of 1.
- If the generated answer is relevant but contains mistakes, \

# The faithfulness evaluator evaluates whether the response is faithful to any of the retrieved contexts.

# This is a step up in complexity from the correctness evaluator. Since the set of contexts can be quite long, they might overflow the context window. We would need to figure out how to implement a form of **response synthesis** strategy to iterate over contexts in sequence.
# 
# We have a corresponding tutorial showing you [how to build response synthesis from scratch](https://gpt-index.readthedocs.io/en/latest/examples/low_level/response_synthesis.html). We also have [out-of-the-box response synthesis modules](https://gpt-index.readthedocs.io/en/latest/core_modules/query_modules/response_synthesizers/root.html). In this guide we'll use the out of the box modules.
