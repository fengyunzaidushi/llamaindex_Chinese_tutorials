# 
# This example shows you how to use the Resume Screener Llama Pack.
# You can find all packs on https://llamahub.ai
# 
# The resume screener is designed to analyze a candidate's resume according to a set of criteria, and decide whether the candidate is a fit for the job.
# 
# in this example we'll evaluate a sample resume (e.g. Jerry's old resume).

#('pip install llama-index llama-hub')

# ### Setup Data
# 
# We'll load some sample Wikipedia data for OpenAI, Sam, Mira, and Emmett. Why? No reason in particular :) 

from llama_index.readers import WikipediaReader

loader = WikipediaReader()
documents = loader.load_data(
    pages=["OpenAI", "Sam Altman", "Mira Murati", "Emmett Shear"],
    auto_suggest=False,
)

# do sentence splitting on the first piece of text
from llama_index.node_parser import SentenceSplitter

sentence_splitter = SentenceSplitter(chunk_size=1024)

# We get the first chunk from each essay.

# get the first 1024 tokens for each entity
openai_node = sentence_splitter.get_nodes_from_documents([documents[0]])[0]
sama_node = sentence_splitter.get_nodes_from_documents([documents[1]])[0]
mira_node = sentence_splitter.get_nodes_from_documents([documents[2]])[0]
emmett_node = sentence_splitter.get_nodes_from_documents([documents[3]])[0]

# We'll also download Jerry's resume in 2019.

# ## Download Resume Screener Pack from LlamaHub
# 
# Here we download the resume screener pack class from LlamaHub.
# 
# We'll use it for two use cases:
# - whether the candidate is a good fit for a front-end / full-stack engineering role.
# - whether the candidate is a good fit for the CEO of OpenAI.
