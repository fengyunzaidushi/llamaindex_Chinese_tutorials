# # Llama API

# [Llama API](https://www.llama-api.com/) is a hosted API for Llama 2 with function calling support.

# ## Setup

# To start, go to https://www.llama-api.com/ to obtain an API key

# If you're opening this Notebook on colab, you will probably need to install LlamaIndex ðŸ¦™.

#('pip install llama-index')

from llama_index.llms.llama_api import LlamaAPI

api_key = "LL-your-key"

llm = LlamaAPI(api_key=api_key)

# ## Basic Usage

# #### Call `complete` with a prompt

resp = llm.complete("Paul Graham is ")

print(resp)

# #### Call `chat` with a list of messages

from llama_index.llms import ChatMessage

messages = [
    ChatMessage(
        role="system", content="You are a pirate with a colorful personality"
    ),
    ChatMessage(role="user", content="What is your name"),
]
resp = llm.chat(messages)

print(resp)

# ## Function Calling

from pydantic import BaseModel
from llama_index.llms.openai_utils import to_openai_function

class Song(BaseModel):
    """A song with name and artist"""

    name: str
    artist: str

song_fn = to_openai_function(Song)

llm = LlamaAPI(api_key=api_key)
response = llm.complete("Generate a song", functions=[song_fn])
function_call = response.additional_kwargs["function_call"]
print(function_call)

# ## Structured Data Extraction

# This is a simple example of parsing an output into an `Album` schema, which can contain multiple songs.

# Define output schema

from pydantic import BaseModel
from typing import List

class Song(BaseModel):
    """Data model for a song."""

    title: str
    length_mins: int

class Album(BaseModel):
    """Data model for an album."""

    name: str
    artist: str
    songs: List[Song]

# Define pydantic program (llama API is OpenAI-compatible)

from llama_index.program import OpenAIPydanticProgram

prompt_template_str = """\
Extract album and songs from the text provided.
For each song, make sure to specify the title and the length_mins.
{text}
"""

llm = LlamaAPI(api_key=api_key, temperature=0.0)

program = OpenAIPydanticProgram.from_defaults(
    output_cls=Album,
    llm=llm,
    prompt_template_str=prompt_template_str,
    verbose=True,

# Run program to get structured output.
